# Personalized Diabetes Management and Behavioral Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project is an AI-enabled digital health platform designed to provide personalized diabetes management strategies and behavioral analytics using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and user-generated data. The platform includes predictive and prescriptive analytics, seamless data integration, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
2. **Model Development**
3. **Behavioral Analytics**
4. **Integration and Deployment**
5. **Monitoring and Optimization**
6. **Compliance and Security**

## Data Collection and Preparation
- Generate dummy data using NumPy for CGM data and user-generated data (meal intake, insulin dosage).
- Preprocess the data and merge based on common identifiers.

## Model Development
- Train a linear regression model to predict glucose levels based on meal intake and insulin dosage.
- Save the trained model using `joblib`.

## Behavioral Analytics
- Analyze patient behavior data to identify patterns and trends.
- Visualize data and design interventions to encourage healthy habits.

## Integration and Deployment
- Deploy the trained model using a Flask API for real-time predictions.

## Monitoring and Optimization
- Monitor model performance and optimize using metrics like average glucose levels, glucose standard deviation, and time in range.

## Compliance and Security
- Implement basic data privacy and security measures using encryption.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavvesmaker/diabetes-management-platform.git
